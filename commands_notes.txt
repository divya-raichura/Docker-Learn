using modern linux kernel we can isolate any process from others and make that process believe it has its own vm when really it doesn't and that includes isolating filesystems, network interfaces, memory resource access the whole thing 

-------------------commands-------------------
- images
docker images 
docker rmi [image id or name]
docker pull
docker inspect [image]

- containers

docker ps (shows running containers)
docker ps -a (shows all containers running/not running)
docker run
docker start 
docker stop
docker rm [container id]
docker top [id/name] -> shows top processes 
docker stats [id/name of container] -> shows stats of container
docker start -a [id/name] (starts an already created container and we also enter it cause of -a flag)
we can connect to that container in another shell using docker attach [id]

why -t flag in docker run

difference between attach and exec
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30960686/difference-between-docker-attach-and-docker-exec

NOTE: docker run is to create new container
while creating we can specify few things about container eg -p -d --name etc
but in start we don't have them, we just do docker start [id] and container will have all those things we gave it during creating it using docker run

- system
docker stats
docker system df
docker system prune
 


 ------------------- more on images -------------------
 docker run ubuntu
 - this command creates an ubuntu container, tho the container is created, it is not running!

 - to go inside and run the container, we can see details in docker hub details for that image
 in this case, docker run -it ubuntu runs the container + we go inside it

 NOTE: why does "docker start [id of container]" not work to run the container after it was created using docker run image?
 https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29599632/docker-container-is-not-running

 docker rm $(docker ps -a -q) (deletes all stopped containers)
 docker rm $(docker images -q) (deletes all the images that are not used)
