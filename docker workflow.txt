docker workflow example

- development using js and mongo db pulled from docker hub
- push to git or vcs
- continuos integration like jenkins build and it will produce artifacts from our application and create docker image 
- this image is pushed to a private docker repo(if it is a company)
- dev server pulls that img from pvt repo and then pulls mongo db that our app depends on from docker hub 
- now we have two containers, our and publicly available mongo container, they talk to each other as per how you configured them and run as an app
- so other developer or tester can use and test it from dev server now
